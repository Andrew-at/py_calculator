This is just a simple calculator I built in python, it started as something to get familiar with Python syntax.
Over time I would like to add more interesting functions to it, such as:
A square root function without using the builtin python sqrt function.
A sequence function that generates a fibonacci sequence of integers from start and end values.
A Pythagoras function, may just stick with hypotenuse but add other sides over time.
